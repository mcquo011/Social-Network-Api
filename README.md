  ## Description 

The Social Network API is a RESTful API that allows users to carry out a number of tasks, including controlling their thoughts and reactions as well as establishing, editing, and deleting user profiles. The Social Network API is a reliable backend solution that facilitates user interactions, content sharing, and community building.

Key features include:

User Management: The API allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of user profiles. User profiles include information such as username, email, and lists of friends.

Thought Management: Users can create, update, and delete thoughts, which are textual content limited to 280 characters. Thoughts can be retrieved individually or as a list associated with a user profile.

Reaction Management: The API supports adding, updating, and deleting reactions to thoughts. Reactions are short text-based responses to thoughts, allowing users to interact with each other's content.

Friend Management: Users can maintain a list of friends by adding and removing other users to and from their friend lists.

Scalable and Extensible: The Social Network API is built using Node.js and Express, providing a scalable and extensible foundation for future growth and additional features.

  ## Dependencies  

    Express (v4.18.2): A web framework for Node.js, which is used to build the API endpoints and handle HTTP requests.

    Mongoose (v7.0.3): A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, that provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model the application data and manage database interactions.

  ## Usage 

  To interact with the API, you can use any REST client like Insomnia. Follow the steps below to get started:

  Before using the API, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* Node.js
* MongoDB


1. Clone the repository or download the source code to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project folder, and run the following command to install the required dependencies:


`npm install`

3. Start the MongoDB server by running the appropriate command for your system.

4. In the project terminal, start the API server by running the following command:

`node server.js`

The server should now be running on the specified port (e.g., http://localhost:3001).

With the server running, you can use a REST to send HTTP requests to the API endpoints. 

Watch the [walkthrough video]() to see the routes.
